## Project Overview
This project involves creating a Power BI dashboard for Claire, the Call Centre Manager at PhoneNow. The goal is to provide a comprehensive and visually appealing overview of key performance indicators (KPIs) and metrics related to the call center's operations. The dashboard is designed to help Claire and her team gain insights into various aspects of call center performance, such as:

- Overall Customer Satisfaction: Tracking customer feedback to gauge satisfaction levels.
- Call Handling: Monitoring the total number of calls answered and abandoned.
- Call Timing Analysis: Analyzing call distribution across different times of the day.
- Response Efficiency: Measuring the average speed of answer to ensure timely responses.

#### Insights:
##### Page 1: Call Volume Analysis
##### Overall Call Metrics:

- Total Calls: The call center handled a total of 5,000 calls during the analysis period.
- Resolution Rate: 72.92% of the calls were resolved, indicating a relatively high success rate in addressing customer issues.
- Average Satisfaction Rating: The average customer satisfaction rating stands at 2.76 out of 5, suggesting there may be room for improvement in customer service.
- Call Volume by Topic:
The majority of calls were related to Technical Support (20.38%), Contract & Streaming Issues (20.44%), and Payment-Related Queries (20.14%).
Administrative Support and Contract-Related Streaming Issues also contributed significantly to the call volume (19.52% and 19.52%, respectively), indicating these are common areas of concern for customers.
- Call Volume by Month:
January recorded the highest call volume (1,782), with a noticeable decline in February (1,616) and March (1,612). This downward trend could be due to seasonal factors, improved service, or reduced customer issues.
- Resolved vs. Unresolved Rate:
Approximately 72.92% of calls were resolved, while the remaining 27.08% were unresolved, which may point to areas where further training or resources are needed to improve resolution rates.
- Busiest Hours of the Day:
The busiest hours for the call center were between 12:00 PM and 1:00 PM, followed by 11:00 AM to 12:00 PM. This insight could be used to allocate more resources during these peak hours to ensure better handling of call volumes.
- Top Rated Agent:
The top-rated agent, "Dan," likely contributed positively to the resolution rate and customer satisfaction. Highlighting such agents can serve as a benchmark for others.
##### Page 2: Customer and Agent Behavior Analysis
- Average Satisfaction Rating Across Topics:
Satisfaction ratings are fairly consistent across topics, with Streaming and Admin Support both scoring an average of 2.8 out of 5, while Technical Support lags slightly behind with a score of 2.7.
- Call Answered vs. Abandoned:
The Streaming and Payment-Related topics had the highest abandonment rates at 16.94% and 16.36%, respectively. High abandonment rates in these areas may indicate dissatisfaction with the call handling process or long wait times.
Conversely, Admin Support had the lowest abandonment rate at 15.90%, suggesting better handling or quicker resolution of these calls.
- Talk Duration vs. Calls Answered:
There is a general trend where longer talk durations correlate with fewer calls answered. This trade-off may reflect the time needed to effectively resolve more complex issues, although it could also highlight inefficiencies in call handling.
- Average Speed of Answer (ASA):
The average speed of answer is 54.75 seconds, which is relatively swift. However, efforts to reduce this further could potentially decrease the call abandonment rate.
- Agent Performance:
The top agents have likely contributed to maintaining a consistent resolution rate of 72.92%. Analyzing agent performance can help in training and distributing workload more effectively.
